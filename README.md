# GetAppVersion

A simple demo, which will retrieve App detail from Google Play Store. User has to provide application package name for which they want to 
retrieve the version detail.

I have used 2 dependencies in this sample

```
implementation "org.jetbrains.anko:anko-commons:0.10.4"
```
which also aims at making various common development tasks easier for us

```
implementation 'org.jsoup:jsoup:1.8.3'
```
Jsoup is a Java html parser. It is a Java library that is used to parse html documents. Jsoup gives programming interface to concentrate and control information from URL or HTML documents. It utilizes DOM, CSS and Jquery-like systems for concentrating and controlling records.
